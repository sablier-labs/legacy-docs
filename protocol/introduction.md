# What is Sablier?

Sablier is a token streaming protocol available on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Ronin, Avalanche, and BSC. It's the first of its kind to have ever been built in crypto, tracing its origins back to 2019. Similar to how you can stream a movie on Netflix or a song on Spotify, so you can stream tokens by the second on Sablier.

If you're a developer, head over to the [guides](./guides/getting-started) section or check the [technical
reference](./technical-reference/streams). Conversely, if you're just interested in learning more about Sablier from a
non-technical standpoint, head over to our [FAQ](/protocol/faq/basics).
