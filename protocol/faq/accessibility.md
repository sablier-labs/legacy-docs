### What can Sablier be used for?

We came up with a few ideas in [this discussion on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sablier/status/1205533344886411264), but
the sky is the limit.

### Who can use Sablier?

Anyone in the world with an Internet connection and an Ethereum wallet.

### The Sablier web interface is down, what can I do?

The Sablier protocol is "always-on", but, in the event that MetaMask or our web interfaces are malfunctioning, you can
access Sablier manually on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888). We
wrote a guide about this on [Medium](https://medium.com/sablier/operating-the-sablier-protocol-manually-e6569092c533).
