### Is the Sablier protocol safe?

The security of the Sablier protocol is our outmost priority. Our team, accompanied by external auditors and
consultants, has invested considerable effort to create a protocol that is safe and reliable. All contract code is
publicly verifiable in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier), and Quantstamp, a third-party
auditor, issued an audit [certificate](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/view/sablier).

### Is the Sablier protocol transparent?

As transparent as it can be. Verify the smart contracts by yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier)
and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/labelcloud/sablier).

### Does the Sablier protocol have an administrator?

No. The contracts do not have any owner or administrator. They are as trustless as an Ethereum contract can be.
