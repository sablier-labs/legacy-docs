Contributing to the Sablier docs is a great way to get involved in the dev community and help other people along the
way.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.
